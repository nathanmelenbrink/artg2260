		<h3> Assignment 3.0: Game </h3>
	</div >

	<div class="small-12 medium-12 large-9  columns">
		<h3> Description: </h3>
		<p> Make a game! This will not be easy, but you most certainly are capable of doing it. You’re strongly encouraged to start with the GameTemplate exercise. The previous exercises may also be useful references. It’s also fine (even encouraged) to look at outside examples as templates for your work, but not okay to copy code directly. If you do use 3rd party code as a template for your own, you are expected to cite it in the header section of your code. For example, suppose I want to see if two objects intersect, but I don’t really know how. I’d Google something like "p5 object intersection” and after clicking through a bunch of unhelpful links, I might find a good tutorial <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAfw-ko3kB8'> here</a>. <!-- I’d then find the section of the code where they test to see if the objects are touching, and dissect that part of the code. I’d then understand that at each frame, they’re checking to see if the right edge of one object is at the same X position as the left edge of the other object.  --> I’d write my own code with my own variable names, but using the ideas I got from the tutorial, so I’d therefore cite it in my header section. </p>

		<p> There are a lot of examples out there, but many of them might be beyond your current skill level, and even worse, some are just terribly written. At any rate, this can be a distraction. Think of an idea first, even make a storyboard if it’s helpful for you. Then use online examples to solve the pieces you can’t figure out on your own, rather than using a whole program as a template. You are expected to be able to verbally explain each line of your code. 

		</p>

		<h3> Requirements: </h3>
		<p> 	
			 Your code must at least include all of the following features:
			 <ul>
			 	<li>A header section in the form of a multiline comment, specifying the class name, your name, your email, assignment number and your choice of title</li>
			 	<li> You make use of at least one array</li>
				<li> You keep track of the score, and display the score as well as game play messages</li> 
				<li> Your game has a compelling and original theme or aesthetic (i.e., not just a re-do of an arcade classic)</li> 
			</ul>
		</p>

		<h3> Hacker Points: </h3>
		<p> 	
			  Complete your choice of the following features (or all) to get bonus points in the assignment:
			 <ul>
			 	<li>Keep track of high scores</li>
			 	<li>Implement easing</li>
			 	<li>Allow for multiple lives, or a “health bar” </li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<h3> Submission: </h3>
		<p> 	
			Create a new directory (folder) in your local repository called "assignment_3_0". Inside that folder, create an index.html and script.js (or copy from prior work). Use GitHub Desktop to commit and push your changes, and verify that they published to the web.
