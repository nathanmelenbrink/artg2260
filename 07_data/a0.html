		<h3> Assignment 7.0: Data Visualization </h3>
	</div >

	<div class="small-12 medium-12 large-9  columns">
		<h3> Description: </h3>
		<p> you are tasked with developing a data visualization. You must first find a data source to work with, other than what has been provided to you in class. This will likely take some effort -- try to be creative! Your visualization should be composed to convey some message -- draw attention to some cause, highlight a key finding in the data, etc. You should include arrange text and style the document for effective visual communication. </p>

		<p> You may use either static or dynamic data. You’re free to use p5, Google Maps, and/or any combination of libraries and other tools to complete this assignment. <!-- There are a number of online tutorials for data visualization in p5  you’re free to begin by following one. As always, please cite any references. --> </p>

		<h3> Requirements: </h3>
		<p> 	
			 Your program must at least include all of the following features:
			 <ul>
			 	<li>A title written on the same HTML page as your sketch, specifying the class name, your name, assignment number and your choice of title</li>
			 	<li> A visualization containing at least 100 data points, either stored in a JSON, CSV etc. in /assets or coming from an API in run-time</li>
			 	<li> Text and styling to formulate an interpretation of the data  </li> 
			 	<li> As always, your assignment will be evaluated for its technical utility as well as its attention to styling and aesthetic refinement </li> 
			</ul>
		</p>

		<h3> Hacker Points: </h3>
		<p> 	
			  Complete your choice of the following features (or all) to get bonus points in the assignment:
			 <ul>
			 	<li> Use an API to access data from a third-party source (different from in-class examples)  </li> 
				<li> Collect user data (ex. Using Google Forms) </li>
				<li> Allow for users to have some interaction with the visualization </li>

			</ul>
		</p>

		<h3> Submission: </h3>
		<p> 	
			Create a new directory (folder) in your local repository called "assignment_7_0". Inside that folder, create an index.html and script.js (or copy from prior work). Use GitHub Desktop to commit and push your changes, and verify that they published to the web. 

			<!-- Capture at least 3 screenshots (using saveFrame()) that showcase the range of possible output of your sketch. Arrange these on 8.5 x 11 (portrait), print it out and bring it to class to pin up.  -->
