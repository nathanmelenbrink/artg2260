		<h3> Assignment 6.0: Kinetic Forms </h3>
	</div >

	<div class="small-12 medium-12 large-9  columns">
		<h3> Description: </h3>
		<p> In this assignment, you are required to demonstrate your knowledge of object-oriented programming, transformations, and physical forces. You should choose one of the following options: 
			<ul> 
				<li> Substantially improve your Assignment 3.0: Animate Form to include forces, transformations, and new class(es). </li>
				<li> Substantially improve your Assignment 5.0: Game to include forces, transformations, and new class(es). </li>
				<li> Produce an entirely new interactive or generative art composition. </li>
			</ul>
		If you already have some kind of physics implementation in your current Assignment 5.0 for example, you'd be required to enhance it in some meaningful way. Ask the forum if this is unclear in your case. 
		</p>


		
		<h3> Requirements: </h3>
		<p> 	
			 Your program must at least include all of the following features:
			 <ul>
			 	<li>A title written on the same HTML page as your sketch, specifying the class name, your name, assignment number and your choice of title</li>
			 	<li> Thoughtful layout and composition, tasteful use of colors and/or images, transparency, etc. </li>
			 	<li> Use of transformations with push() and pop() </li> 
			 	<li> The program is reasonably object-oriented and makes use of at least one array of objects.</li>
				<li> There is some interaction between some object and an array of objects </li> 
			</ul>
		</p>

		<h3> Hacker Points: </h3>
		<p> 	
			  Complete your choice of the following features (or all) to get bonus points in the assignment:
			 <ul>
			 	<!-- <li>Implement easing</li> -->
			 	<li>Learn about <a href='http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-1-vectors/'>p5 Vectors</a> and use vector math to add forces to objects </li>
			 	<li>Make animated sprites or create physics effects with the p5 Play library </li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<h3> Submission: </h3>
		<p> 	
			Create a new directory (folder) in your local repository called "assignment_6_0". Inside that folder, create an index.html and script.js (or copy from prior work). Use GitHub Desktop to commit and push your changes, and verify that they published to the web.
