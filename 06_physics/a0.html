	<div class="small-12 medium-12 large-9  columns">
		<h3> Description: </h3>
		<p> 

		</p>
<!-- Artists explore software as a medium for pushing drawing in new directions. Drawing with software provides the ability to integrate time, response, and behavior with drawn marks. 

Information from the mouse (introduced in Input 5, p. 245) can be combined with techniques of motion (introduced in Motion 2, p. 291) to produce animated drawings that capture the kinetic gestures of the hand and reinterpret them as intricate motion. 

Other unique inputs, such as voice captured through a microphone and body gestures captured through a camera, can be used to control drawings. -->
