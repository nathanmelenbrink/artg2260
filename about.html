		 <h3> Course Description</h3>
		
		<p> This course exposes students to basic programming and computational design for animation and interaction. It offers students an opportunity to become familiar with the logical elements of programming languages. Through lectures, hands-on in-class exercises, and iterative projects, it explores web-based design and programming solutions for creating animations, simulations, simple applications and user interfaces. 
		</p>

		<h3> About This Course</h3>
		
		<p> This course will introduce you to the expansive world of creative coding. The primary deliverable of this course is a final project for which you’ll be encouraged to explore a specific area of your own interest. You will develop basic fluency in programming and enhance your analytical thinking skills. </p>

		<p> The primary tool used in the course will be p5, which is the JavaScript version of a programming language called Processing. Processing is a simple yet powerful development environment and Java-based language that’s designed to be straightforward to learn yet oriented towards in the visual arts. P5 offers both the simplicity of Processing as well as the ubiquity of JavaScript.

		<h3> Course Forum </h3>
		<p>
		This  <a href='https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!forum/artg-2260-spring-2018-02' >Google Group</a> will be used for announcements and all other communications outside of class. Most importantly, you are to use this group as a forum for help with assignments. You will all likely find yourselves stuck many times with problems or concepts you don’t fully understand. Relax -- this is a good sign. Programming is challenging, and getting stuck just means that you’re pushing the boundaries of your knowledge. I won’t be able to hold conventional office hours, so we’ll use this Google Group as a collective resource for troubleshooting. So if you’re stuck or have a question about the assignment, simply post your question to the group. Don’t be shy about posting; you’re probably not the only one who’s having the same issue. Once your question is answered, your classmates may be grateful to see it as a reference. The idea is that your questions will be answered not only by me, but also by your fellow classmates. This will reflect very positively on your participation grade. </p>

		<p> There’s no such thing as a stupid question, but there is such a thing a poorly-phrased and confounding question. Good questions yield good replies. There is an example of a well-posed question on the forum. As should go without saying, the forum is an extension of the classroom, and University conduct policies still apply. Practice good forum etiquette. Help each other out, no trolling, keep cat GIFs to a minimum, etc. </p>


		<h3> Grading</h3>
		<p>
			The overall grade you will earn in this course will be based on the following: </p>
			<uL>
				<li> 10% Active participation in presentation, discussion, forum, and workshop sessions 
				<li>10% In-class Exercises
				<li>45% Weekly Assignments 
				<li>35% Final Project 
			</uL>
		<p>	
			In-class exercises are graded for completion. For weekly assignments as well as the final assignment, half the grade is earned by demonstrating the technical requirements, while the other half is earned through efforts put towards a styling and aesthetic composition. If you have any questions about how your grade was determined, don’t hesitate to ask. 

		</p>

		<h3> Time Management</h3>
		<p>Learning to program requires serious dedication and a lot of time designing, coding, testing, debugging, and revising. Programming is an incredibly iterative process. Expect to spend a considerable amount of time outside of class working on your programs. Programming is time consuming and mysterious bugs can send you on a tailspin at any moment, thus, if you begin working on a program immediately after it’s assigned, you’ll have enough time to seek help in the event you get stuck. I strongly encourage you to try to finish Exercises in class, and start on Assignments within a day of class. If you start with the content fresh in your mind, it’ll take you less time overall to finish the work. </p>

		<h3> Use of 3rd Party Code</h3>
		<p>For your code exploration assignments and project work you are expected to write original code. You must be able to explain how your program functions whenever asked. It is acceptable and encouraged to seek design, coding, and debugging assistance from other students, staff, or faculty in order to complete your work. Likewise, you are encouraged to help other students whenever possible. You are encouraged to study and learn from code examples. You may use third-party libraries to simplify coding, however, grading is based on the functionality of your original code along with the clarity of your comments and documentation. Whenever you incorporate third party open source materials in your work you must properly attribute the works sourced. Any student submitting work that can be reasonably believed to not be their own will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct and Complaint Resolution according to the Northeastern University Academic Integrity Policy. </p>
