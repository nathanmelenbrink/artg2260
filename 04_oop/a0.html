		<h3> Assignment 4.0: Game </h3>
	</div >

	<div class="small-12 medium-12 large-9  columns">
		<h3> Description: </h3>
		<p> Make a game! This will not be easy, but you most certainly are capable of doing it. You’re strongly encouraged to start with the Game Template exercise. The previous exercises may also be useful references. This will be an assignment in two parts (both counted as a standard weekly assignment). The first part, due next week, will require you to implement an object-oriented game concept. The second part will require you to implement new classes and develop interactions between objects. For example, you may wish to make a game that uses a similar dynamic as the arcade classic asteroids, but with a fresh new theme. The first week, you could focus on representing the field of asteroids as an array of objects. The second week you could add a new class for the character and check for hits against the asteroids. Remember that attention to styling and composition are graded with equal importance to technical achievement. You should make efforts on this front both weeks. We will do a brief review of everyone's progress next week. 
		</p>

		<!-- It’s also fine (even encouraged) to look at outside examples as templates for your work, but not okay to copy code directly. If you do use 3rd party code as a template for your own, you are expected to cite it in the header section of your code. For example, suppose I want to see if two objects intersect, but I don’t really know how. I’d Google something like "p5 object intersection” and after clicking through a bunch of unhelpful links, I might find a good tutorial <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAfw-ko3kB8'> here</a>. --> <!-- I’d then find the section of the code where they test to see if the objects are touching, and dissect that part of the code. I’d then understand that at each frame, they’re checking to see if the right edge of one object is at the same X position as the left edge of the other object.  --> <!-- I’d write my own code with my own variable names, but using the ideas I got from the tutorial, so I’d therefore cite it in my header section.</p> --> 

		<!-- <p> There are a lot of examples out there, but many of them might be beyond your current skill level, and even worse, some are just terribly written. At any rate, this can be a distraction. Think of an idea first, even make a storyboard if it’s helpful for you. Then use online examples to solve the pieces you can’t figure out on your own, rather than using a whole program as a template. You are expected to be able to verbally explain each line of your code. 

		</p> -->

		<h3> Requirements: </h3>
		<p> 	
			 Your code must at least include all of the following features:
			 <ul>
			 	<li>A title written on the same HTML page as your sketch, specifying the class name, your name, assignment number and your choice of title</li>
			 	<li>Also, please write (in the HTML comment) a sentence or two about your intended next steps.</li>
			 	<li> Make use of at least one class</li>
			 	<li> Make use of at least one array of objects</li>
				<li> Keep track of the score, and display the score as well as game play messages</li> 
				<li> Develop a compelling and original theme or aesthetic </li> 
			</ul>
		</p>

		<h3> Hacker Points: </h3>
		<p> 	
			  Complete your choice of the following features (or all) to get bonus points in the assignment:
			 <ul>
			 	<li>Keep track of high scores</li>
			 	<li>Implement easing</li>
			 	<li>Allow for multiple lives, or a “health bar” </li>
			 	<li>Make animated sprites or create physics effects with the p5 Play library </li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<h3> Submission: </h3>
		<p> 	
			Create a new directory (folder) in your local repository called "assignment_4_0". Inside that folder, create an index.html and script.js (or copy from prior work). Use GitHub Desktop to commit and push your changes, and verify that they published to the web.
