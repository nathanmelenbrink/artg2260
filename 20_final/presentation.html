		<h3> Presentation: </h3>
		<p> We will all gather to present our final projects to each other and to a distinguished guest jury on the evening of April 5th, 2018 at 6pm sharp. Please expect to stay for the duration, which will likely go until 9:30pm. If you have other commitments or need to present at a specific time, please let me know and I’m sure we can accommodate. </p>

		<p>
		You are expected to prepare a slide deck and deliver a presentation and demonstration of your project to the class that should last no longer than 7 minutes total. That will leave time for the jurors (as well as your fellow students) to offer critical feedback and ask you further questions about your project. 
		Try to make your slide deck concise to leave time for your demo. A good slide deck might consist of the following slides: 
		Introduction / Overview
		Motivation (what’s the problem or issue you want to address?)
		Related Work (who’s done similar projects?)
		Novelty (what are the main features that make your project unique?)
		Process (how did you arrive at this idea?)
		Challenges (what were the new things you had to learn to complete the assignment?)
		Next Steps (what would you next if you had more time?)
