		<h3> Description: </h3>
		<p> For this stage of the Final Project, you should work with your partners to develop three distinct proposals for your group's Final Project. This can include any combination of your individual ideas, but should be further developed. What is the research question? What are you seeking to discover? What is your metric for success? You should write a paragraph for each proposal, ordered by preference (put your collective favorite idea first).</p>

		<p> For the proof of concept, you should identify the (likely) most challenging technical aspects of your concept and provide a “proof of concept” that your concept is technically feasible. You may find that you need to pivot your idea and try again. For most of you, this can be achieved by finding a relevant tutorial and completing it<!--  (there is no novelty or creativity expected for this particular assignment, though you’re welcome to have fun with it) -->.  <!-- For others it might not be straightforward. Therefore, please prioritize finding a suitable tutorial ASAP. Please share your intentions with me before you begin (either verbally during the end of class, or by posting a link to your thread if you need more time after class). --> </p>

		<h3> Submission: </h3>
		<p> Post your text to a new thread on the forum, with the first names of the group members as the subject heading.  </p>
