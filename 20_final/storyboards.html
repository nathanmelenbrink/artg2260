		<h3> Description: </h3>
		<p> For this stage of the Final Project, you are required to outline at least two options for your final project in storyboard format. There are no specific guidelines for how to organize your storyboard -- you should use whatever format allows you to most quickly and effectively communicate your idea. I strongly encourage sketching on paper as a means of quickly iterating through design ideas, but you may also draw in Photoshop, Illustrator, or other software.  </p>

		<p> The storyboards should communicate the intended user experience of your final project (as opposed to the internal mechanics). You can draw it as a series of panels, a flowchart, some combination of the two, etc. Sketches should be legible, but perfection is not a priority. Try to put down on paper as many ideas as you can -- at this stage we’re looking for quantity over quality. </p>

		<p>Compose a forum post with your images (phone photos of your sketches are fine) and a minimal amount of text needed to explain your ideas. As before, you are also required to offer constructive criticism to at least one of your classmate’s storyboards. </p>

		<h3> Submission: </h3>
		<p> Upload your work by the deadline to the Google Group, under the group forum thread you’ve already started.</p>
