		<h3> Assignment 9.0: Sound and Vision </h3>
	</div >

	<div class="small-12 medium-12 large-9  columns">
		<h3> Description: </h3>
		<p> Create an application that responds to a 3rd party media signal, such as audio or video. The signal may be real-time or pre-recorded. You could think along the lines of a music visualizer, a streaming video filter, an audio effect, or some combination of these, etc. Feel free to look at outside projects/tutorials for inspiration. Your assignment should use the techniques covered in class, but the creative output should be substantially different from the examples we covered so far.  </p>

		<h3> Requirements: </h3>
		<p> 	
			 Your program must at least include all of the following features:
			 <ul>
			 	<li>A title written on the same HTML page as your sketch, specifying the class name, your name, assignment number and your choice of title</li>
			 	<li> Use at least one library </li>
			 	<li> Use at least four functions that are specific to a library you’ve added. For example, if you use p5 Sound, you might use play(), loop(), input() and analyze()  </li> 
			 	<li> As always, your assignment will be evaluated for its technical utility as well as its attention to styling and aesthetic refinement </li> 
			</ul>
		</p>

		<h3> Hacker Points: </h3>
		<p> 	
			  Complete your choice of the following features (or all) to get bonus points in the assignment:
			 <ul>
			 	<li> Create additional DOM elements that you can use to control your visualization </li> 
				<li> Implement an additional library that we didn’t cover in class (recommended p5 play or seriously.js) </li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<h3> Submission: </h3>
		<p> 	
			Create a new directory (folder) in your local repository called "assignment_9_0". Inside that folder, create an index.html and script.js (or copy from prior work). Use GitHub Desktop to commit and push your changes, and verify that they published to the web. 

			<!-- Capture at least 3 screenshots (using saveFrame()) that showcase the range of possible output of your sketch. Arrange these on 8.5 x 11 (portrait), print it out and bring it to class to pin up.  -->
